# Package Feeds

This repo contains a few subprojects to aid in the analysis of open source packages, in particular to look for malicious software.

These are:

[Feeds](./feeds/) to watch package registries (PyPI, NPM, etc.) for changes to packages
and to make that data available via a single standard interface.

This repo used to contain several other projects, which have since been split out into
github.com/ossf/package-analysis.

The goal is for all of these components to work together and provide extensible, community-run
infrastructure to study behavior of open source packages and to look for malicious software.
We also hope that the components can be used independently, to provide package feeds or runtime
behavior data for anyone interested.
